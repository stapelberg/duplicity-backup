This script serves as an example for what you could use. It uses duplicity in a
reasonable way to create incremental backups to the FTP server of my hoster (1
full backup every 7 days, backups are kept for a month). In the second part of
backup.sh, it uses xen-lvm-snapshot, a script which automatically makes and
mounts snapshots of virtual machine disks.

Configuration is done in common.sh.
